# CONTRIBUTING

## pre-commit

For convenience, all of the latest result images are included in `dist` directory.
If you add or edit .svg files, you should execute `build.sh` to re-generate images
before commiting .svg files.

So it is recommended to set `pre-commit` script to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
